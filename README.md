# README 
This README provides an overview and explanation of the code snippet you provided. It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database.
# REQUIREMENTS TO RU THE PROGRAM
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database system
- A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or set up a project with the provided code.

2. Install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

4. Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

5. Start the web server. Depending on your setup, you might run a command like:

```shell
npm start
```

Ensure the server starts without any errors.

6. Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7000`).
7. ### HTML Structure
8.  Head part- The title and metadata of a web document are contained in the head element. Body part- The body element includes the information that you wish to display on a web page
9.  
10.  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
### Create Operation

The code checks if the `edit_id` variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.
### Book List

The code uses a loop (`{{#each masala's}}`) to iterate over a list of books.

For each book, it generates an `<li>` element containing the book's product and price. It also includes two links: "Edit" and "Delete". The "Edit" link includes the book's `_id` as a query parameter (`edit_id={{this._id}}`) to identify which book to edit. The "Delete" link includes the masala's `_id` as a query parameter (`delete_id={{this._id}}`). It also includes an `onclick` event to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the book.
## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new books and editing existing ones, as well as displaying a list of books with options to edit or delete each book.
